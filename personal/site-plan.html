        First things first, what is tennis? Tennis is a sport played on 3 different surfaces (hard, clay, grass) where you have a rectangle divided by a net, with a racquet and a tennis ball (yellow green-ish small ball). The game can be played by a minimum of two and a maximum of four players inside the court. The goal of Tennis is to make more points than your opponent, this happens when you cross the ball over the net with your racquet and the opponent is not able to cross the ball back. The points of the game are counted as the player that wins 2 sets first, each set made of 6 games, and each game has 4 points - depending on the tournament this can change, but this is the base of it. This is pretty much the core of tennis, and it's important to say that tennis is a classic and refined sport, different from other games, you cheer your favorite player throughout the match but between the points, the crowd must be silent. Another interesting thing about tennis is that different from other sports where you cheer for a team, sometimes the one from your city or country, in tennis you cheer for a specific player (or more than one, of course).

      <h3>The Match</h3>
      <p>
        Now, what made me watch this sport? well, we have to come back to 2021 when the Olympic Games in Tokyo happened - important to say that the Covid-19 pandemic was happening, so I had a lot of free time to watch the games. There at the 2021 Olympic Games, Brazil won its first medal in tennis in the history of the country in the Olympic Games and that was the first tennis match that I watched. The protagonists of Brazil were Luisa and Laura the last doubles team to enter the women's double tennis list. So, they started to win the matches, some of them pretty heroics, until they lost the semifinals, going then to dispute the bronze medal. Not going to give the full details of the match but Luisa and Laura, representing Brazil, were facing The Russian Committee. The game was pretty tight and in the super tiebreak, a game of 10 points played when ties one set each side in a doubles match, the opponents had 9/5 - in other words, they just needed one more point to win the match - but Brazil saved 4 match points (the four chances that the opponents had of winning the match) and made the score became 9/9 after this Brazil made two more points and made history. It's hard to describe this match in words, I invite everyone to watch at least the super tie break because even if you are not Brazilian, you can feel the emotion that this match had - every time I watch the super tie-break again I cry.

      <h3>Favorite Players</h3>
      <p>
        So, the emotion I felt in this match made me want to learn more about the sport and become a fan of it - tennis is not a very common sport around here in Brazil, especially because of all the resources you need to play. When I started to look more about what tennis was one of the first few things I did was to look for the Brazilian players and it was there that I started to cheer and watch Luisa's matches playing women's doubles and Beatriz playing singles (another Brazilian player that recently entered the top 10 of woman's tennis). Just like I love to watch any Brazilian game, football for example, watching both of them became something that I enjoy.
