        <p><b>Now, what made me watch this sport?</b> well, we have to come back to 2021 when the Olympic Games in Tokyo happened - important to say that the Covid-19 pandemic was happening, so I had a lot of free time to watch the games.</p>

        <p id="match-paragraph">There at the 2021 Olympic Games, Brazil won its first medal in tennis in the history of the country in the Olympic Games and that was the first tennis match that I watched. The protagonists of Brazil were Luisa and Laura the last doubles team to enter the women's double tennis list. So, they started to win the matches, some of them pretty heroics, until they lost the semifinals, going then to dispute the bronze medal. Not going to give the full details of the match but Luisa and Laura, representing Brazil, were facing The Russian Committee. The game was pretty tight and in the super tiebreak, a game of 10 points played when ties one set each side in a doubles match, the opponents had 9/5 - in other words, they just needed one more point to win the match - but Brazil saved 4 match points (the four chances that the opponents had of winning the match) and made the score became 9/9 after this Brazil made two more points and made history. It's hard to describe this match in words, I invite everyone to watch at least the super tie break because even if you are not Brazilian, you can feel the emotion that this match had - every time I watch the super tie-break again I cry.</p>
